**Sahana-Setup** is a collection of my personal scripts and procedures to
set up Sahana instances. You are welcome to re-use them and/or to help me
improving them and keeping them up-to-date.

To find out how you can use this, check the [wiki](https://github.com/nursix/sahana-setup/wiki).

**Credit:**

My scripts are partially derived from the installation/configuration
scripts in the official [Sahana Installation Guidelines](http://eden.sahanafoundation.org/wiki/InstallationGuidelines),
which have been written, field-tested and maintained for many years mainly by my colleague [Fran Boon](https://github.com/flavour/).
